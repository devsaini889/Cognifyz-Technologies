## Completed Tasks
During my internship, I worked on the following tasks:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Predicting Restaurant Ratings**
**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Approach:**
- Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained regression models such as **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regression**.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared Score (R¬≤)**.
- Identified key features influencing restaurant ratings.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Restaurant Recommendation System**
**Objective:** Create a recommendation system based on user preferences.

**Approach:**
- Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Implemented a **Content-Based Filtering** recommendation system.
- Considered user preferences such as cuisine type, price range, and location.
- Provided personalized restaurant recommendations based on similarity metrics.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Location-Based Analysis of Restaurants**
**Objective:** Perform a geographical analysis of restaurants using latitude and longitude data.

**Approach:**
- Visualized restaurant locations on a map using **Folium and Matplotlib**.
- Grouped restaurants by city and analyzed their density.
- Calculated statistics such as average ratings, cuisine distributions, and price ranges by locality.
- Discovered insights related to restaurant clustering and popular locations.
